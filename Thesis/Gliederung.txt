pdb shader debug information







Introduction
- Advantage of Debuging (Debugging is coool!!!)
- No general tools for debugging shader code with the graphics pipeline exist.
- Existing Approaches for compute pipeline;
- Platform specific solutions
- Target a general solution by using existing debuging tools for other languages translating shader code

Related Work (Which parts of debugging are done how:)
- Existing debugging methods for shader code with the graphics pipeline
- Simulation/Translation methods for shader code with the compute pipeline

Contribution
-Necessary steps for simulation (shader pipeline)
-necessary steps for translation

Implementation
-specific problems with C# and GLSL
