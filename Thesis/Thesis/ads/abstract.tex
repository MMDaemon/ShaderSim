\begin{abstract}

Debugging is a big part of the programming process. Most programming languages are supported by different debugging tools. For writing shaders within the graphics pipeline, the existing tools and support for debugging are very scarce and most of the tools provided are limited to use with specific hardware and specific drivers for said hardware.

This thesis provides a solution to enable the use of different debugging tools for shaders in the graphics pipeline without the dependency on specific hardware or drivers while still providing the advantage of being executable on the GPU. To achieve this, the shader will be written in a language supported by debugging tools while being executed in a simulated version of the graphics pipeline on the CPU. This shader is then translated to a regular shader language to run on the GPU.
